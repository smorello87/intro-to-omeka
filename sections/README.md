# Introduction to Omeka

Omeka is a simple, free web publishing system built by and for scholars that is used by hundreds of archives, historical societies, libraries, museums, and individual researchers and teachers to create searchable online databases and scholarly online interpretations of their digital collections. If you have a digital collection of primary sources that you want to publish online in a scholarly way, youâ€™ll want to consider Omeka. Developed by the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media at George Mason University, Omeka allows to describe the items according to academic archival standards, import and export that descriptive information from other systems, and to create as many interpretive online exhibits as you like from those items.


By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:

- Understand some of the conceptual challenges faced when developing digital archives 
- Create an online database of digital archival items
- Create a public facing exhibition featuring items from your collections
