## Is Omeka the right tool for my class?

Building a WordPress course site on the [Commons](https://commons.gc.cuny.edu/) is usually a better and more flexible option if you are looking for a something that allows your students to access and engage class material, write content, and interact with one another. Omeka is best suited for projects that involve metadata and a sizable digital (or digitizable) collection that you want to curate, organize, and describe. The good news is that you don&#39;t have to choose between the two options! You can easily link your Omeka site to your WordPress site (and even style it in a similar way), allowing each platform to do what it does best.

## Project Ideas

- Archival Preservation 

Digitizing and describing objects from pysical archives and creating metadata descriptions and virtual exhibits.

- Archival Recovering and Archival &quot;Remixing&quot;

Presenting visual analyses or reinterpretations of holdings, including born digital material, from other websites or digital archives.

- Coursework archiving

Omeka is also flexible platform that allows teachers to collect (and display to the public, if desired) final course projects, such as digital and multimedial essays, with metadata attached.

## Desirable Outcomes:

- Digital Literacy
- Archival Research Skills
- Public-Facing Academic Writing
- Collaborative Work
- Community Engagement

## Best Practices.

1. Plug-ins for classroom use

[TeachingHistory.org recommends](https://teachinghistory.org/digital-classroom/tech-for-teachers/25115) four plug-ins for classroom use: [Docs Viewer](https://omeka.org/classic/plugins/DocsViewer/) (for scanned or digital files in DOC, PDF, PPT, or any image files), [Simple Pages](https://omeka.org/classic/plugins/SimplePages/) (which allows users to create a standalone page, such as an About page or course syllabus), [CSV Import](https://omeka.org/classic/plugins/CsvImport/) (for importing large quantities of items into the collection using an Excel CSV sheet), and [Exhibit Builder](https://omeka.org/classic/plugins/ExhibitBuilder/) (which offers the ability to create rich expository exhibits around selected items and collections). Extended documentation is available on the Omeka website for all four plugins. Other plugins that can be of use in the classroom are: [Editorial](https://omeka.org/classic/plugins/Editorial/), [Image Annotation](https://omeka.org/classic/plugins/ExhibitImageAnnotation/), [Text Annotation](https://omeka.org/classic/plugins/TextAnnotation/), [Simple Vocab](https://omeka.org/classic/plugins/SimpleVocabPlus/), and [Neatline](https://omeka.org/classic/plugins/Neatline/).

2. Get familiar with [user permissions](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Admin/Users/) and [Omeka theming](https://github.com/GCDigitalFellows/omeka/blob/master/sections/themesplugins.md)– customize your website with logos, picture headers, customized menu categories, or match the stylesheet of your Omeka site to that of your course blog. Play around with the website and familiarize with the platform before your class starts – the [Omeka Gym](https://omekagym.omeka.net/about) and [Omeka for Millenials](https://lilybeauvilliers.wordpress.com/2015/05/14/omeka-for-millenials/) are two fun ways to do just that.
3. Consider developing metadata guidelines _with_ the students in class and compile some sample items in a spreadsheet with them.
4. Hold a session on Copyright and licensing. [Alston Cobourn points](https://jitp.commons.gc.cuny.edu/spreading-awareness-of-digital-preservation-and-copyright-via-omeka-based-projects/) to this useful [tool to teach Copyright and licensing](https://jitp.commons.gc.cuny.edu/spreading-awareness-of-digital-preservation-and-copyright-via-omeka-based-projects/).
5. Develop a process-based grading rubric.

&quot;In assessing [students&#39;] work, it is important to be mindful of the learning process; remember that they are professionals in training, and they should not be judged on their first attempt but rather on the progress they achieve by the time they graduate.&quot; ([Allison C. Marsh](https://academic.oup.com/dsh/article-abstract/28/2/279/1037192?redirectedFrom=fulltext))
