Give your website a subdomain name, a title, and a description. 

```
Subdomain name: baltmanandco[#].omeka.net
Site title: B. Altman & Co.’s Archive
Site description: The B. Altman & Co.’s Archive collects documents, images, videos, and other digital artifacts relevant to the history of the department store founded by Benjamin Altman in 1865 in New York City. 
```

Go back to your account and click on _Manage Site_ to access your website’s dashboard.

Remember, only authorized users can access the backend of your site. If your site was a restaurant, this would be the kitchen. In other words, this is where you will create and organize all of the content that is presented on your site. 

![dashboard](dashboard.png)

You have two menus in your dashboard. One on the left that allows you to create and edit content; and one on the top, which allows you to deal with the structure of your website. Let’s begin with the latter.
