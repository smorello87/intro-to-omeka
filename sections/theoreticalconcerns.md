# Theoretical Concerns

Before we engage with the creation of our Omeka database, let’s take a few minutes to think about the conceptual concerns that we have to face when engaging with digital archival work. 

We encourage you to discuss these short and long term concerns with librarians and archivists in your field. It is often crucial to tackle and think through these issues before you start working on your project and uploading items to your Omeka site, as they might influence the shape of the technological infrastructure you are developing. 

* Metadata standards

__Metadata__ is data about data, or information about an item. It includes the documentation of data architecture, properties, and methods necessary to store, retrieve, and use the data in a meaningful manner. For example, bibliographic metadata is the title, author, publisher, date and so on of a publication. Omeka encourages you to describe every item with lots of metadata, which is part of what makes it a scholarly system. By default, Omeka relies on Dublin Core, a metadata standard used by libraries and archives for digital items that consists of 15 basic fields that can be used to describe any digital object, no matter what it is. Such basic fields include Creator, Subject, Description, Date, Rights, and so on. 

Example: http://coloredconventions.org/items/show/278 

Beware: Doublin Core is __not__ the only metadata schema. Different catalogues, archives, and fields of inquiry rely on different standards. The way in which item you’re describing your items should reflect the way you want your catalogue to interact with the world and the way you want it to be interpreted. 

Omeka does also allow adding additional standard metadata fields and creating custom metadata fields, but this may make it more difficult to transfer your data to and from Omeka and other systems, since these systems need a shared vocabulary to “talk” to one another. The fact that Omeka is built on Dublin Core means that your data is likelier to last longer, because it can be moved to other systems later. There are prompts built in to Omeka that will help you understand what information to put in every Dublin Core field, but you can also consult the [Dublin Core User Guide section on Creating Metadata](https://github.com/dcmi/repository/blob/master/mediawiki_wiki/User_Guide.md).

In addition to selecting a metadata standard or schema, whenever possible you should also use __controlled vocabularies__. A controlled vocabulary provides a consistent way to describe data. Examples of controlled vocabularies include subject headings, thesauri, ontologies, and taxonomies. Using a controlled vocabulary will aid in searching and finding your data and will make your data consistent and more shareable with researchers in the same discipline. In Omeka, you can build your own controlled vocabularies or use the standards suggested by DublinCore. Keep in mind that even if you're not using a controlled vocabulary, you should be as consistent as possible with your metadata. For example, if you use “New York, NY” in the “Coverage” field, make sure you follow the same City, State format when compiling the same field for other items.

* Informational architecture of your website 
  * Discoverability 
  * Accessibility
* Rights and permissions
* Sustainability
  * Ongoing guardianship  
  * Preservation 

As you can see, there is a fair amount of work that goes into designing your project, before you begin uploading your material!
