# Introduction

Omeka is a free __Content Management System (CMS)__ used to create a searchable online database of digital archival items such as images, audio, and video files. It allows you to describe the items according to academic archival standards, import and export that descriptive information from other systems, and to create as many interpretive online exhibits as you like from those items.

Think of the way a museum works: all the museum holdings are divided into collections, only some of which is publicly displayed and interpreted by plaques and labels written by museum curators. CMS work like that. Some large institutions, such as the New York Municipal Archives or the Metropolitan Museum of Art, rely on all-encompassing CMS, such as DSpace and Fedora. They are robust infrastructures able to manage an extremely vast amount of data and to serve a number of purposes, such as automate and manage collections-based tasks and workflows, and facilitate communication between museum staff. In such large settings, Omeka can still be of use: for example, it allows you to import collections from these larger (often expensive) platforms and make them accessible and available on the web. In order to do this, it relies on __Dublin Core__, a Metadata Standard set that makes linked open data possible and collections more discoverable. In other words, through Dublin Core, Omeka and the databases on which it relies are able to talk to one another. 

In other cases, however, Omeka can function as a stand-alone lightweight CMS with the capacity for greatness. For people who have never worked in collection management, Omeka can be an entryway to learn the basics of cataloguing and digital archival work. Omeka’s content can be moved between platforms and requires a fairly small set of metadata criteria to catalogue its collections. Let's look at some examples. 


## Sample Sites
* [The City of Boston archives](https://cityofbostonarchives.omeka.net/) is an excellent example of an Okema website in which a selected set of data from a larger database, most likely managed by a different CMS, was imported. The City of Boston archives relies on the basic functions of Omeka that we are going to explore today to catalogue and display a set of items, sort them into collections, and use them to tell stories in the form of digital exhibitions. 

* [Colored Conventions](http://coloredconventions.org/) is a website that uses Omeka a stand-alone CMS and fully takes advantage of the platform's potential. This collaborative project aims to collect rare proceedings, newspaper coverage, and petitions from state and national political meetings of once captive Black people between 1830 and 1890. Colored Conventions is also a great example of how Omeka and digital archiving can work as pedagogical tools. It received awards from the MLA, ASA, and PCA/ACA along with grants from the NEH, Mellon Foundation, and CLI.

## Omeka VS Omeka.net
Omeka is NOT desktop software that you install on your own machine, it’s what’s called “server-side software.” There are two ways to use Omeka: you can download a free, open-source version of the server-side software at omeka.org, or, if you don’t have server space or would just rather not deal with it, you can sign up for free or paid “hosted” versions at [Omeka.net](http://omeka.net). 

For practical purposes, we will make use of the latter during this workshop. Despite having a limited set of functionalities, Omeka.net operates in the same way as the self-hosted version.  

## Today’s Exercise
We are going to create and populate a database with artifacts from B. Altman’s & Co., the department store that until January 1990 resided in the building that now houses CUNY's Graduate Center. We are then going to create a sample exhibition that uses the items in our collections to tell the story of the store in the first two decades of the 1900s.
