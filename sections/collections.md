# Collections

Collections are ways of organizing items, rather like file folders on your computer, or like collections in archives such as [“Papers of William Faulkner, 1929-1965”](http://ead.lib.virginia.edu/vivaxtf/view?docId=uva-sc/viu02364.xml) in the Special Collections of the University of Virginia. Collections provide a way to organize your items into separate, logically coherent groups. Items do not have to be in collections, but in Omeka Classic once an item is in a collection, it can’t be in any other collection. You can make as many links as you like between items in different collections, though, with tags and exhibits. 

Example: [cityofbostonarchives.omeka.net/collections](http://cityofbostonarchives.omeka.net/collections)

## Create a Collection

We are now going to create three collections (“Advertisements,” “Buildings,” and “Misc”) and add the items we just created to them. 

To create a collection, click on the _Collections_ link on the left menu, then on _Add a Collection_. You’ll be prompted to enter metadata for your collection, which consists of information that pertains to __all the items__ in it. 

Once you’ve entered title and metadata for your collection, click on _Add Collection_. Repeat theses steps for the other two collections.

## Add Items to a Collection

We can now return to the items we’ve previously created and add them to our collections. 

Let's start with the Altman Building. Click on _Items_, identify the item “Altman Building, New York, N.Y., ca. 1906”, click on _Edit_, select the collection “Buildings” from the dropdown menu on the right, and click on _Save Changes_.

Now try and add the rest of the items to the other collections we created!

```
Advertisements:
"The Question of Spring Clothes"
White Sale Commercial

Misc:
B. Altman & Co's logo (1865)

Buildings: 
Altman Building, New York, N.Y., ca. 1906
```

For future reference: remember that if a collection already exists when you create an item, you can add it as you create it.
