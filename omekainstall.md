# Getting Started with Omeka.net

Omeka is a simple, free web publishing system built by and for scholars that is used by hundreds of archives, historical societies, libraries, museums, and individual researchers and teachers to create searchable online databases and scholarly online interpretations of their digital collections. If you have a digital collection of primary sources that you want to publish online in a scholarly way, you’ll want to consider Omeka.
 
For the purpose of this workshop, we are going to take Omeka for a test run by registering a free account on (http://www.omeka.net "Omeka.net").
